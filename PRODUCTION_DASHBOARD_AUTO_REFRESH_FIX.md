# Production Dashboard Auto-Refresh Fix

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### Problem 1: Dashboards Not Updating
**Issue**: Team Member and Department Leader dashboards were not auto-refreshing when tasks were updated.

**Root Cause**: No periodic refresh mechanism or storage event listeners.

**Solution Applied**: Added auto-refresh every 30 seconds and storage event listeners.

### Problem 2: Task Member Management
**Issue**: Users couldn't easily add/remove members from task cards.

**Status**: Already implemented in EnhancedTaskModal.js
- Add member button exists
- Remove member button exists
- Available users dropdown works
- Role selection (assignee, collaborator, reviewer, observer)

## 🔄 Auto-Refresh Implementation

### Team Member Dashboard

**Before**:
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  loadDashboardData();
}, []);
```

**After**:
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  loadDashboardData();
  
  // Listen for storage events (when tasks are updated in other tabs)
  const handleStorageChange = (e) => {
    if (e.key === 'tasksUpdated' || e.key === 'dashboardRefresh') {
      loadDashboardData();
    }
  };
  
  window.addEventListener('storage', handleStorageChange);
  
  // Set up periodic refresh every 30 seconds
  const refreshInterval = setInterval(() => {
    loadDashboardData();
  }, 30000);
  
  return () => {
    window.removeEventListener('storage', handleStorageChange);
    clearInterval(refreshInterval);
  };
}, []);
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
- ✅ Responds to tasksUpdated events
- ✅ Cross-tab updates work
- ✅ No annoying alerts on refresh
