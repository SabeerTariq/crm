## 🎯 Current Issue: Redirect Loop

### Problem Identified

When a department leader logs in:
1. ✅ Redirects to `/production-head-dashboard` (correct)
2. ✅ ProductionHeadDashboard detects leader role
3. ✅ Fetches department_id from API
4. ✅ Redirects to `/department-leader-dashboard/{departmentId}`
5. ❌ BUT: The component also tries to load production-head API, which fails

### Solution Applied

Modified ProductionHeadDashboard.js to:
- Check if user is department leader before loading data
- Skip API call if user is department leader
- Only load production head data if user is actually production head

---
