   - Personal performance metrics
   - Efficiency score
   - Task completion progress

### ✅ Phase 2: Frontend Components (COMPLETED)

#### Created 3 Dashboard Components:

1. **ProductionHeadDashboard.js**
   - Welcome header with stats
   - 4 overall statistics cards (gradient styling)
   - Departments grid with performance indicators
   - Department performance comparison table
   - Recent tasks list (last 20 tasks)

### ✅ Phase 3: Integration (COMPLETED)

#### Routing
- Added routes in `App.js`:
  - `/production-head-dashboard` → ProductionHeadDashboard
  - `/department-leader-dashboard/:departmentId` → DepartmentLeaderDashboard
  - `/team-member-dashboard` → TeamMemberDashboard

#### Role Utilities
- Added to `client/src/utils/roleUtils.js`:
  - `hasProductionHeadRole()` - checks role 8
  - `hasProductionLeadRole()` - checks roles 9, 11, 13, 15, 17
  - `hasProductionMemberRole()` - checks roles 10, 12, 14, 16, 18

#### Sidebar Navigation
- Added production dashboard menu item in Sidebar.js
- Only visible to production-head role
- Icon: `fas fa-cogs`
- Menu text: "Production Dashboard"

### 🎨 UI/UX Features

#### Design System
- **Gradient Cards**: Each stat card has unique gradient
- **Color-coded Status**: Pending (amber), In Progress (blue), Review (purple), Completed (green)
- **Priority Badges**: Visual priority indicators (low, medium, high, urgent)
- **Progress Bars**: Animated progress bars for completion tracking
- **Responsive Grid**: Auto-adjusting grid layouts
- **Empty States**: Helpful empty states with icons
- **Smooth Animations**: Transition effects on hover and state changes

#### Key Features
1. **Real-time Data**: Fetches latest data on load
2. **Role-based Access**: Each dashboard shows appropriate data
3. **Performance Tracking**: Efficiency scores and completion rates
4. **Task Organization**: Kanban board for visual task management
5. **Filtering**: Multiple filter options for tasks
6. **Responsive**: Works on all screen sizes
