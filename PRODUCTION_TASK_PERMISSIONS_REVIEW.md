## 🎯 Permission Logic

### Task Creation
- **Who can create**: production-head, department leads
- **Where**: Tasks can be created in projects with department assigned
- **Auto-assignment**: Tasks get `department_id` but `assigned_to` is NULL initially

### Task Assignment
- **Department Leaders**: Can assign tasks to their department members via their dashboard
- **API**: `POST /api/tasks/:id/assign` with `{ assigned_to: userId }`
- **Permission required**: `task_members:create` and `tasks:update`

### Task Status Updates
- **Members**: Can update task status (Pending → In Progress → Completed)
- **Leaders**: Can update any task in their department
- **Required**: `tasks:update` permission

### Task Viewing
- **Members**: See only tasks assigned to them (`assigned_to = user_id`)
- **Leaders**: See all tasks in their department (`department_id = user_department`)
- **Production Head**: Sees all tasks across all departments
- **Required**: `tasks:read` or `tasks:view`

## 🔐 Permission Enforcement

### Backend Middleware
All task endpoints use:
```javascript
auth              // Verify user is logged in
authorize('tasks', 'action')  // Verify user has permission
```

### Example Routes
```javascript
// Create task - needs 'create' permission
router.post('/', auth, authorize('tasks', 'create'), ...)

// Update task - needs 'update' permission
router.put('/:id', auth, authorize('tasks', 'update'), ...)

// Delete task - needs 'delete' permission
router.delete('/:id', auth, authorize('tasks', 'delete'), ...)

// Read tasks - needs 'read' permission
router.get('/', auth, authorize('tasks', 'read'), ...)
```

## 📊 Dashboard Access

### Department Leader Dashboard
- ✅ View all tasks in their department
- ✅ Kanban board with status columns
- ✅ Assign tasks to team members
- ✅ View team member performance
- ✅ Track task progress

### Team Member Dashboard
- ✅ View tasks assigned to them
- ✅ Filter by status (Pending, In Progress, Completed)
- ✅ Update task status
- ✅ View task details
- ✅ Track personal progress

### Production Head Dashboard
- ✅ View all departments
- ✅ See task statistics for each department
- ✅ Overall performance metrics
- ✅ Recent tasks across all departments

## 🚀 Task Workflow

### 1. Task Creation
1. Project has department assigned
2. Task created with `department_id`
3. `assigned_to` = NULL initially
4. Status = "New Task"

### 2. Department Leader Assigns Task
1. Leader opens department dashboard
2. Sees unassigned task in "Pending" column
3. Clicks "Assign" button
4. Selects team member from dropdown
5. Confirms assignment
6. Task now shows in member's "My Tasks"

### 3. Member Updates Status
1. Member opens their dashboard
2. Sees assigned task
3. Updates status: Pending → In Progress
4. Works on task
5. Updates status: In Progress → Completed

### 4. Leader Tracks Progress
1. Leader refreshes dashboard
2. Sees task moved to "Completed" column
3. Team member's stats updated
4. Overall department efficiency calculated

## ✅ Summary

All production roles now have appropriate task permissions:

- ✅ **All department leads** can create, read, update, delete, and manage tasks
- ✅ **All department members** can read, update, and view tasks (assigned to them)
- ✅ **Task assignment** functionality is fully permission-protected
- ✅ **Status updates** work correctly for members
- ✅ **Dashboard access** is role-based and secure

The system is ready for production use! 🎉
