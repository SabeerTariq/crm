# Task Assignment - Complete System Review

## ✅ System Overview

The task assignment system uses **TWO mechanisms**:

1. **Direct Assignment** (`assigned_to` field in `project_tasks`)
2. **Task Members** (`task_members` table for collaboration)

---

## 📋 Database Structure

### 1. `project_tasks` Table
**Key Field**: `assigned_to` (INT, NULL)
- Stores the primary assignee of the task
- NULL = unassigned task
- Updated via `POST /api/tasks/:id/assign` or `PUT /api/tasks/:id`

### 2. `task_members` Table
**Purpose**: Multiple users can be associated with a task in different roles
- `assignee` - Primary worker
- `collaborator` - Helper
- `reviewer` - Reviews work
- `observer` - Watches progress

---

## 🔄 Task Assignment Flow

### Method 1: Direct Assignment (Primary Method)

#### A. Task Creation with Assignment
**Location**: Project Details → Add Task

```javascript
// client/src/pages/ProjectDetails.js
const handleCreateTask = async (e) => {
  await api.post('/tasks', {
    ...taskFormData,
    project_id: id
  });
};
```

**Backend Processing** (`TaskService.createTask`):
1. Creates task in `project_tasks` with `assigned_to` field
2. If `assigned_to` is provided, updates task
3. Also adds task creator as `collaborator` in `task_members`
4. Automatically adds department lead as `reviewer` in `task_members`
5. If `assigned_to` is provided and different from creator, adds them as `assignee` in `task_members`

**SQL Updates**:
```sql
INSERT INTO project_tasks (..., assigned_to) VALUES (..., ?)
INSERT INTO task_members (task_id, user_id, role) VALUES (?, ?, 'collaborator')
INSERT INTO task_members (task_id, user_id, role) VALUES (?, ?, 'reviewer')
INSERT INTO task_members (task_id, user_id, role) VALUES (?, ?, 'assignee')
```

#### B. Task Assignment via Modal
**Location**: Task Management → Task Modal

**Frontend API Call**:
```javascript
api.put(`/tasks/${taskId}`, { assigned_to: userId })
```

**Backend Processing** (`TaskService.updateTask`):
```javascript
static async updateTask(taskId, updateData) {
  // Updates project_tasks.assigned_to field
  UPDATE project_tasks SET assigned_to = ? WHERE id = ?
}
```

#### C. Assignment via Department Leader Dashboard
**Future Feature**: Kanban board with "Assign" button

**Proposed Flow**:
```javascript
// When leader assigns from dashboard
api.post(`/tasks/${taskId}/assign`, { assigned_to: userId })
```

**Backend**: Already implemented in `routes/tasks.js`

## ✅ Current Implementation Status

### Task Creation ✅
- **Location**: Project Details page
- **Works**: Creates task with `assigned_to` field
- **Department**: Task gets `department_id`
- **Status**: Default "New Task"
- **Members**: Automatically adds creator, department lead, and assignee to `task_members`

### Task Assignment via Modal ✅
- **Location**: Task Management page → Click task → Edit
- **API**: `PUT /api/tasks/:id` with `{ assigned_to: userId }`
- **Works**: Updates `assigned_to` field in database
- **User List**: Now includes production users (roles 7-18)

### Task Members System ✅
- **Location**: Task Modal → Members tab
- **API**: `POST /api/tasks/:id/members`
- **Purpose**: Add multiple users to a task
- **Roles**: assignee, collaborator, reviewer, observer
- **Works**: Full implementation with CRUD operations

### Available Users for Assignment ✅
- **API**: `GET /api/tasks/:id/available-users`
- **Updated**: Now includes all production roles (7-18)
- **Returns**: Users with roles: admin, sales, upseller, production-head, designers, developers, SEO, content, QA

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### 1. Create Task and Assign
**Steps**:
1. Go to Project Details
2. Click "Add Task"
3. Fill in task details
4. Select department
5. Select user from "Assigned To" dropdown
6. Submit

**Expected Result**:
- Task created with `assigned_to = selected_user_id`
- Task appears in user's dashboard
- Task appears in department leader's dashboard
- Task members table has creator + department lead + assignee

### 2. Assign Existing Task
**Steps**:
1. Open Task Management
2. Click on unassigned task
3. In modal, change "Assigned To" dropdown
4. Select a user
5. Save

**Expected Result**:
- `project_tasks.assigned_to` updated
- Task appears in selected user's dashboard
- Activity log created

### 3. Add Task Members (Collaborators)
**Steps**:
1. Open Task Modal
2. Go to "Members" tab
3. Click "Add Member"
4. Select user and role
5. Save

**Expected Result**:
- New entry in `task_members` table
- User gets notifications
- User appears in task members list

### 4. View Assigned Tasks
**Steps**:
1. Login as production team member
2. Go to Team Member Dashboard
3. View "My Tasks"

**Expected Result**:
- Shows only tasks where `assigned_to = current_user_id`
- Can update task status
- Can view task details

```
Task Creation
    │
    ├─→ project_tasks.assigned_to = userId
    │
    ├─→ task_members (creator → collaborator)
    │
    ├─→ task_members (dept_lead → reviewer)
    │
    └─→ task_members (assigned_to → assignee)

Task Assignment
    │
    └─→ UPDATE project_tasks SET assigned_to = ? WHERE id = ?

Task Viewing
    │
    ├─→ For Team Members: WHERE assigned_to = user_id
    │
    ├─→ For Department Leaders: WHERE department_id = dept_id
    │
    └─→ For Production Head: All tasks

```
